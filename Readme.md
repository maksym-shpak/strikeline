# 🎯 Strikeline — High-Performance Gamma Exposure Visualizer (WebGL Powered)

**Strikeline** is a real-time gamma exposure visualizer built for speed, clarity, and trader insight.  
It leverages **WebGL via `regl`** to render complex financial heatmaps, curves, and volatility markers in under **10ms** — even at **60+ FPS**.

Designed with ✨ *interactive clarity* and ⚡ *rendering power* in mind.

## ⚡ Why Strikeline?

Traditional financial charts struggle with:

- 🔁 Frequent updates (gamma shifts fast intraday)
- 📊 High data density (hundreds of strikes)
- 🎨 Complex overlays (heatmaps, glow, volatility)
- 🧠 Visual cognition (traders read structure, not just values)

**Strikeline solves all of that.**

## 🖼️ What It Does

- ✅ **Renders gamma exposure curve** as a smooth, performant WebGL line.
- ✅ **Generates a real-time heatmap background**, colored by gamma intensity:
  - 🔴 Red for negative gamma
  - 🟣 Purple for positive gamma
  - ⚫ Near-zero zones fade to black
- ✅ **Visualizes `Last Close`** as a stabilized yellow marker inside the most active gamma zone.
- ✅ **Identifies and displays High/Low Volatility Points** by analyzing gamma slope (derivative).
- ✅ **Strike markers** (vertical ticks) show structure and granularity.
- ✅ **Soft glow effect** around gamma line, GPU-rendered for zero performance loss.
- ✅ **All UI overlays** (labels like "Last Close") rendered as lightweight HTML for crisp text without compromising WebGL speed.

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- ⚛️ **React + Vite**
- 🧠 **regl** (WebGL abstraction)
- 📏 **Canvas**: full-screen, retina-ready, responsive
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS**: layout and overlay styling
- 🧪 **Cursor**-ready: modular `.cursorrules`, testable, Storybook integration planned

---

## 🚀 Performance

> Initial render time: **~5ms**
>  
> Average update time (500 gamma points): **<10ms per frame**

- No GC pauses
- No SVG overhead
- No canvas 2D bottlenecks
- Pure GPU-accelerated rendering

You could even run this on a Chromebook and hit 60 FPS.

## 📐 Architecture

- `GammaChart.tsx` — the orchestration layer (canvas + draw calls)
- `regl/create*` — atomic draw command factories:
  - `createBackgroundHeatmap`
  - `createGammaLine`
  - `createGammaGlow`
  - `createXAxis`, `createStrikeMarkers`, `createLastCloseLine`
  - `createVolatilityMarker`
- `hooks/` — logic like `useGammaExposure`, `useLastClose`, `useVolatilityPoints`
- 🎯 Separation of concerns: logic, data, visuals — each scoped, performant, and testable.

---

## 📊 Built For

- Fintech teams building trading dashboards
- Quant devs seeking real-time feedback loops
- Researchers and strategists analyzing option gamma clusters
- Web performance nerds who like GPU pixels more than pixels per div

---

## 🧠 Future Ideas

- Add OI (Open Interest) overlays
- Real data adapters: Deribit, CME, SpotGamma-style APIs
- Zoom/pan interaction using gesture system
- Storybook snapshots for visual regression
- SSR-safe fallbacks for static snapshots

## 🐾 Author

Built by someone who:
- thinks in `dpr`,
- measures in `gl_FragColor`,
- and loves that ~10ms render tick like a good entry point on SPX 0DTE.
